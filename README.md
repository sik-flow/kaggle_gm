# Most Common Employers of Kaggle Competitors

## Background
I recently noticed that of the top 10 ranked Kagglers (in Competitions) 7 of them either worked at H2O.ai or Nvidia. I wanted to explore this to see if this was a trend where these 2 companies employed more highly ranked Kaggle Competitors than other companies.

## Data
I scraped the Top 1000 ranked Kaggle competitors from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rankings). From there I was able to pull the employer and job title from each competitor.

## Notebooks 
I used the following notebooks: 
- 1_Grab_Data - used to scrape data 
- 2_Clean_data - used to clean the scraped data 
- 3_Visual - used to make visuals 

## Results
Can be seen in this [blog post](http://sikflow.io/2021/08/09/kaggle-common-employers)
